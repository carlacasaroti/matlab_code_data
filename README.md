# matlab_code_data

To use the code, take the following combination of files in order to compute the KL divergence, JS distance, global accuracy and,
separation threshold for of the 5 best features to distinguish the 2 classes:
- spectral features using: agua.txt and noagua.txt;
- spatial features using: aguaspat.txt and noaguaspat.txt;
- textural features using: agua_tex.txt and noagua_tex.txt.

The code comments are all in Brazilian portuguese, not too hard to understand with Google Translator nowadays :)
Happy coding!
